## 🚀<u> **60 Most Important Java Programs: Beginner to Advanced (P01–P60)**</u>
A complete collection of Java programs written by **SAROJ DHITAL**, covering everything from basic arithmetic to advanced OOP, data structures, recursion, algorithms, and file handling.
If you're preparing for university exams, coding tests, or entry-level interviews, this repo gives you a solid and practical foundation. Each program is simple, direct, and focused on one concept at a time.

   • P21: Multiplication table of a number  
   • P22: Sum of first n natural numbers  
   • P23: Factorial using loops  
   • P24: Fibonacci series  
   • P25: Palindrome number  
   • P26: Reverse a number  
   • P27: Sum of digits  
   • P28: Armstrong number  
   • P29: Prime numbers in a range  
   • P30: Right triangle star pattern
***
4. <u> **Arrays & Strings (P31–P40)**</u>  
These programs introduce array manipulation, string operations, and basic algorithms.

   • P31: Matrix sum (initialized values)  
   • P32: Matrix transpose  
   • P33: Largest element in an array  
   • P34: Smallest element in an array  
   • P35: Linear search  
   • P36: Bubble sort  
   • P37: Reverse an array  
   • P38: Count vowels and consonants  
   • P39: String palindrome check  
   • P40: Reverse a string
***
5. <u> **Functions/Methods & OOP Basics (P41–P50)**</u>  
These programs introduce modular code and the fundamentals of object-oriented programming.

   • P41: Method to check prime  
   • P42: GCD using Euclid’s algorithm  
   • P43: Recursive factorial  
   • P44: Recursive Fibonacci  
   • P45: Basic class and object  
   • P46: Constructor and `toString()`  
   • P47: Method overloading  
   • P48: Simple inheritance  
   • P49: Passing arrays to methods  
   • P50: Method overriding
***
6. <u> **Advanced Algorithms & OOP Projects (P51–P60)**</u>  
This section covers exam and interview–focused topics like exceptions, data structures, file handling, and design patterns.

   • P51: Custom exception for age validation  
   • P52: Stack implementation using arrays  
   • P53: Binary search  
   • P54: File writing and reading  
   • P55: Abstract class example  
   • P56: Interfaces and multiple inheritance  
   • P57: Multithreading using `Runnable`

## 🎯<u> **Why This Repo Matters?**</u>

### For Exams:  
Many of these programs match typical university lab questions and viva topics. They’re clean, short, and easy to understand.

### For Interviews:  
Most entry-level Java interviews test:  
- Loops  
- Conditionals  
- Arrays  
- Recursion  
- OOP  
- Exceptions  
- Basic algorithms  

This repo covers all of them in a structured way.
